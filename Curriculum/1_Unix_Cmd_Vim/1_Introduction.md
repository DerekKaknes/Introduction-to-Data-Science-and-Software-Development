# An Introduction to the Unix Shell, Command Line and Vim
In this class, you will be introduced to the command line or terminal
application as well as [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and [Zshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell),
two common Unix shells. At the end of this class, you should feel
a basic level of comfort executing commands from bash/zsh, navigating the Unix
directory structure, writing shell scripts from a text editor (preferably
[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))), "piping" together
several shell scripts, and configuring your shell profile to customize your
development environment.  By the end of this class you may still feel a slight
pull towards the use of your mouse, but don't worry... that will soon pass!

# Pre-work Before Class
Before attending this class, you should view and complete the following:

1. [Codecademy's Learn the Command
Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) module.
2. [Open Vim's Interactive Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/).

# Class Objectives
In order to complete this class, you will be expected to demonstrate the ability
to complete the following exercises:

1. Navigate your computer's entire folder directory and list all files from
Bash.
2. Write a shell script that reads a text file, finds all of the vowels and
pipes them into a new textfile.
3. Configure your Bash.profile so that it loads your local setings when the
application loads.
4. Use Vim and Vundle to customize your text editor.
5. Comfortably explain what your PATH variable is, where to find it and how to
change it from the command line.

# Extra Resources for Those Interested
Here are some extra resources that are not required, but which some students may
find valuable:

1. [Mike G's Bash HOW-TO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html) is a
comprehensive introduction to Bash.  This may be a little intense for students
without an existing knowledge of shell scripts, but is a great repository for
any future reference.
