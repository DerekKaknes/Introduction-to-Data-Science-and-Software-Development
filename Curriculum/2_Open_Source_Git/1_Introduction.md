# Open Source: An Introduction to the Git Workflow and Github
You are already familiar with github because you are reading this!  But in this
lesson you are going to learn why it is such a powerful tool for organizing
software development.

# Pre-work Before Class
Before attending this class, you should view and complete the following:

1. [Codeaceademy's Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
2. [Github Guides Introduction to
Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
3. [Code School's Intro to Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

# Class Objectives
In order to complete this class, you will be expected to demonstrate the ability
to complete the following exercises:

1. Explain what `git` is and how developers use it.  Explain the difference
between `git` and "github" (not the same thing!).
2. Be able to create a new git repository (`git init`) to track file changes on your local
machine.
3. Be able to create and connect to a remote git (`git remote`) directory in order to share
your code with others and to retrieve their changes (`git fetch` or `git pull`).
4. Be able to clone or fork an existing remote repository onto your local
machine.
5. Be able to explain the git workflow: branch, develop, stage, commit (with
good messages!), squash, rebase, submit pull request, merge, push.
